===============================

[Scalate 1.6](http://scalate.github.io/scalate/blog/releases/release-1.6.0.html), released 2012-12-21
----

* Built against scala 2.10
* support stripping newlines from output in SSP templates
* Test that consecutive Jade includes work.
* unexpected fragment in parse results: improved error reporting, empty string is emitted instead of "()" - representation of Unit returned from println
* use zinc server for incremental compilation when available
* java.io.File.toUrl is deprecated
* Predef.error is deprecated in Scala 2.10
* Applications should never catch subclasses of java.lang.Error
* Remove unused scala-mojo-support from POM.
* Precompiled template loading was broken.  If the compiler is not installed, throws a ResourceNotFoundException instead of a TemplateException since we don't want to short circuit attempting to load other templates which might be precompiled.
* When Global is not on the classpath, a Throwable is thrown, not an Exception.
* disable maven.glassfish.org (nexus is now maven.java.net), there's some transitive dependency calling this that causes problems for maven-scalate-plugin if you don't have it cached locally
* Fix method name used in reflection.
* convert to mixed java/scala module so we can use the standard Maven Java Mojo extractors.  Drop use the the scala-mojo support.
* It's a jar not a bundle.
* Fix maven-compat version.
* Clean up pom so that build works.
* Fix bad group ID on scalatra-mojo-support.
* scalamd has been published upstream, roll back to it.
* Use public versions of all plugins; now builds clean with -Pdownload.
* Removed pure expression in statement position, according to scalac warning.
* Hide Tuple style accessors _1, _2 etc because IntrospectorTest does not expect to see them. The test failure could be fixed the other way around, but my feeling is that named properties are more useful inside a template than numbered ones.
* Adjusted to scala.tools.nsc.io.AbstractFile API change
* Fixed "missing parameter type" error.
* scalate-util module declares packaging type bundle. Update dependency coordinate to match that.
* Update artifactIDs on website with Scala binary compatability tag.
* Vainly add self to pom.
* Add pooling for pegdown
* Add a test for pegdown filtering
* Fix package name in pegdown addon.index
* Make Pegdown filter a class so extensions can be configured
* Clean up pom so that build works.
* Pickup some wikitext snapshot changes.
* Fix bad group ID on scalatra-mojo-support.
* Reset the Scala Compiler between runs.
* Append _${scala-version} tag to all artifact IDs to denote Scala binary compatibility.
* Don't depend on backout after fatal errors, it's a Scala bug.
* scalamd has been published upstream, roll back to it.
* Use public versions of all plugins; now builds clean with -Pdownload.
* Upgrade to scala-maven-plugin 3.1.0 for incremental compilation.
* Revert "Enable commented LoopTest."
* Make scalate-archetypes-itests versions match.
* Move addon filters into their own subpackages
* Enable commented LoopTest.
* Scala Tools is dead. Long live Sonatype.
* Changes to support OSGi with 2.10.0
* Discarding exception: let all subclasses of Error pass unaffected. When a class is found on the classpath but could not be loaded due to an LinkageError, the developer needs to know about this.
* Discarding caught exception: let subclasses of Error pass unaffected
* Rethrowing excpetion: use explicit Throwable type ascription to pacify the compiler
* Exception wrapping: let VirtualMachineError and ThreadDeath pass unaffected
* Removed redundant try/catch
* updated mvnplugins to 1.27-SNAPSHOT, awaiting Scala 2.10 compatible release
* Removed pure expression in statement position, according to scalac warning.
* Fixed a deprecation warning: pass on minimizeEmpty property of Element being processed
* Hide Tuple style accessors _1, _2 etc because IntrospectorTest does not expect to see them. The test failure could be fixed the other way around, but my feeling is that named properties are more useful inside a template than numbered ones.
* Fixed some deprecation warnings in the compiler
* Scala 2.10: scala.reflect.ClassTag instead of scala.reflect.Manifest
* Removed explicit adding of scala-library, scala-compiler and scalate-core bundles to compiler classpath. Client bundle needs to import relevant packages anyway to load the classes later, so the necessary bundles will be added by ClassPathBuilder.fromBundle.
* Add bundle to classpath only once irregardles of the number of imported packages. LinkedHashSet is used to preserve correct order.
* Override Global.classPath to our generated classpath.
* Do not create ServletTemplateEngine for every view, reuse once created one. Invoke boot class.
* Switched from presentation compiler to regular one to get around bytecode generation problem. See: https://gist.github.com/3488314
* Adjust to scala compiler API change.
* Adjusted to scala.tools.nsc.io.AbstractFile API change
* Commented out a test that breaks Scala compiler. See: https://gist.github.com/3488124
* Fixed "missing parameter type" error.
* scalate-util module declares packaging type bundle. Update dependency coordinate to match that.
* Update scala version to 2.10.0-M7, scalate-test to 1.9-2.10.0-M7-B1
* Treat None case with and without parents the same in invertedSection
* Upgrade to latest jruby
* Have ScalateView properly register its ServletRenderContext objects
* Change jrebel maven repo as the older does not longer exist, add option <updatePolicy> = always
* Add parens to effectful shutdown methods.
* Add a shutdown method on Compiler
* Now that TemplateEngine uses a ScalaCompiler, it needs a method for shutting it down.
* Scaml declarations use at signs, not ampersands. Thanks, josiahg.
* Update 500.scaml to import scala.util.parsing.input.Position by full name instead of relative package.
* Avoid duplicate TemplateSource reads unless using pipeline
* Reset scala Source before read to support multiple reads
* Do not retry template compilation twice
* Use buildhelper plugin to include src/main/scala as source dir
* Fixed {children} macro to work with static web sites.
* Switching to the 1.4-SNAPSHOT release of wikitext
* [#120] Made some classloader changes for running in an OSGi environment.
* Refactored ConfExport Mojo so that it re-uses code from scalate-tool.
* Add support for sass/scss @import
* Comment out the support bits as it's not official.
* Added Less Filter and attempted to modify the sbt and Maven builds to match this and the previous Pegdown filter.
* Added PegDown filter
* selective scuery attribute updates (update attribute if it exists)
* Fixed bug introduced in last commit - removing org.apache.axis:axis-jaxrpc dependency from POM
* Updated assembly descriptor for refactored confexport command
* Upgraded axis-wsdl4j dependency from 1.2 to 1.5.1

[Scalate 1.5.0](http://scalate.github.io/scalate/blog/releases/release-1.5.0.html), released 2011-06-01
----

* Fixes[#244](http://scalate.assembla.com/spaces/scalate/tickets/244) Error Page Template not display if precompiled and source excluded from webapp

* added a sample to test out the use of precompiling templates
* fixes [#228](http://scalate.assembla.com/spaces/scalate/tickets/228) to provide a JRebel plugin for Scalate so that templates are reloaded whenever JRebel reloads a class. Its pretty pessimistic so far; we should be able to minimise the reloading of templates using JRebel's dependency tracking
* Add doco that the scss and sass filters are available.
* Trimming files form the haml distro that are not needed at runtime.
* Fixes [#227](http://scalate.assembla.com/spaces/scalate/tickets/227) : Added scss and sass filters!
* Use the right javadoc annotation style.
* removed some unnecessary dependencies from poms
* made scala-compiler a default dependency so that mvn jetty:run and mvn tomcat:run work fine; folks can always exclude the dependency or specify it a provided scope dependency if they want to exclude it from a WAR
* Update the description of the from parameter since it can be a HTTP url too now.
* omit the div declaration when a class or style attribute is available.
* Fixes [#225](http://scalate.assembla.com/spaces/scalate/tickets/225) We now check to see if the scala compiler is installed and disable template reloading if it's not.  Also print a more descriptive message if we HAVE to compile a template and it's not available.
* Run the html through the tidy command if it's available, strip the doctype header, and handle multi line text areas properly.

[Scalate 1.4.1](http://scalate.github.io/scalate/blog/releases/release-1-4-1.html), released 2011-02-25
----

* Fixes [#219](http://scalate.assembla.com/spaces/scalate/tickets/219) removes the error attributes from the request context if scalate directly rendered the error page.
* Fixes [#221](http://scalate.assembla.com/spaces/scalate/tickets/221) to add a scalate-web dependency and use it in scalate-war for simplicity
* Added scala-library dependency to scalate-util; if you want to exclude this dependency due to different scala versions you can add an exclusion easily. scala-compiler is an optional dependency on scala-core now
* Fixes [#220](http://scalate.assembla.com/spaces/scalate/tickets/220) so that we can use tomcat:run inside archetypes and projects inside scalate

[Scalate 1.3.2](http://scalate.github.io/scalate/blog/releases/release-1-3-2.html), released 2010-11-24
----

* new [set](http://scalate.github.io/scalate/documentation/ssp-reference.html#set) [velocity directive](http://scalate.github.io/scalate/documentation/ssp-reference.html#velocity_style_directives) in [Ssp](http://scalate.github.io/scalate/documentation/ssp-reference.html#syntax) which lets you assign sections of the template output to attributes so you can more easily pass information into layouts.
* minor refactoring of internal classes such as Resource and ResourceLoader from the org.fusesource.scalate.support package into the org.fusesource.scalate.util package to make the util package more stand alone and reuseable outside of Scalate.
* scalate-util module now refactored out of scalate-core
* both scalate-core and scalate-util now OSGi bundles

For more detail see the [Full Change Log](http://scalate.assembla.com/spaces/scalate/milestones/300141-1-3-1)

[Scalate 1.3.1](http://scalate.github.io/scalate/blog/releases/release-1-3-1.html), released 2010-10-27
----

* for folks migrating from Erb, [Ssp](http://scalate.github.io/scalate/documentation/ssp-reference.html#syntax) now supports Erb style comments
* [ScalatePackage classes](http://scalate.github.io/scalate/documentation/user-guide.html#dry) can now be properly auto-detected for templates which reside in the WEB-INF directory in a web application.
* works inside OSGi containers
* all documentation now correctly included in the distro

For more detail see the [Full Change Log](http://scalate.assembla.com/spaces/scalate/milestones/300141-1-3-1)

[Scalate 1.3](http://scalate.github.io/scalate/blog/releases/release-1-3.html), released 2010-10-08
----

* [Jade](http://scalate.github.io/scalate/documentation/scaml-reference.html#jade) template syntax is now supported which is a dialect of [Haml](http://haml-lang.com/) or [Scaml](http://scalate.github.io/scalate/documentation/scaml-reference.html)
* New [Servlet Filter](http://scalate.github.io/scalate/documentation/user-guide.html#using_scalate_as_servlet_filter_in_your_web_application) which allows more flexible mapping of templates in a web application. For example you can have the request */foo.xml* automatically bound to */foo.xml.ssp* if the template exists letting you easily implement views without requiring a controller or routing in your MVC layer. 
* [JSP Converter](http://scalate.github.io/scalate/documentation/jspConvert.html) helps you migrate your existing JSP web application across to Scalate
* [HTML Converter](http://scalate.github.io/scalate/documentation/htmlConvert.html) lets you migrate your existing HTML files easily to [Scaml](http://scalate.github.io/scalate/documentation/scaml-reference.html) or [Jade](http://scalate.github.io/scalate/documentation/scaml-reference.html#jade) for extra DRY markup 
* [DRY template imports, values and logic](http://scalate.github.io/scalate/documentation/user-guide.html#dry) thanks to Scalate Package objects which allow imports, values and methods to be shared across some or all of your templates to reduce noise inside your templates.
* [Site Generator](http://scalate.github.io/scalate/documentation/siteGen.html) lets you generate static or dynamic websites using templates and/or wiki markup together with exporting wiki content from Confluence wikis to migrate to using git/svn as your wiki content repository. You can also use [a common bootstrap approach](http://scalate.github.io/scalate/documentation/siteGen.html#bootstrapping) now across both static website generation and web applications - such as to configure wiki macros in a canonical way. We now eat our own dog food and generate this site using Scalate.
* More filters and pipelines supported such as confluence as well as the existing markdown which are particularly useful for website generation (static or semi-static).
* The [Scalate Tool](http://scalate.github.io/scalate/documentation/tool.html) now comes with a full interactive shell with full tab completion to make it easier to use the tool either for ad hoc or interactive shell use.

For more detail see the [Full Change Log](http://scalate.assembla.com/spaces/scalate/milestones/208429-1-3)


[Scalate 1.2](http://scalate.github.io/scalate/blog/releases/release-1-2.html), released 2010-07-30
----

* Scalate now supports the [Mustache](http://scalate.github.io/scalate/documentation/mustache.html) template language which is a Scala dialect of [Mustache](http://mustache.github.com/) for logic-less templates which also work inside the browser using [mustache.js](http://github.com/janl/mustache.js). Support for Mustache uses the same common Scalate API so it works with all the existing Scalate adapters such as servlets, [JAXRS](http://scalate.github.io/scalate/documentation/jog.html), [Lift](http://scalate.github.io/scalate/documentation/lift.html) or [Play](http://github.com/pk11/play-scalate) and [Apache Camel](http://camel.apache.org/scalate.html)
* Scalate is [now built](http://scalate.assembla.com/spaces/scalate/tickets/70) on top of [Scala 2.8.0 final release](http://www.scala-lang.org/node/7009) 
* [Scuery](http://scalate.github.io/scalate/documentation/scuery.html) for jQuery style transformation of HTML or XHTML using CSS3 selectors
* the [console](http://scalate.github.io/scalate/documentation/console.html) can be more easily reused in your application [without using WAR overlays](http://scalate.assembla.com/spaces/scalate/tickets/105) and templates can be loaded via the classloader to help make more modular web applications without relying on WAR overlays
* [improvements](http://scalate.assembla.com/spaces/scalate/tickets/94) in associating different template languages to files/URIs/strings/streams in a more flexible API
* [various](http://scalate.assembla.com/spaces/scalate/tickets/108) [improvements](http://scalate.assembla.com/spaces/scalate/tickets/109) in the accuracy of the mapping of scala compiler errors to positions in the template source file which are then shown and linked in the [console](http://scalate.github.io/scalate/documentation/console.html)
* improved [maven plugin](http://scalate.github.io/scalate/documentation/user-guide.html#precompiling_templates) for precompiling templates

For more detail see the [Full Change Log](http://scalate.assembla.com/spaces/scalate/milestones/191841-1-2)


[Scalate 1.1](http://scalate.github.io/scalate/blog/releases/release-1-1.html), released 2010-04-15
----

* [Ssp](http://scalate.github.io/scalate/documentation/ssp-reference.html#syntax) now supports [Velocity style directives](http://scalate.github.io/scalate/documentation/ssp-reference.html#velocity_style_directives) for more concise looping and branching.
* new [Scalate Tool](http://scalate.github.io/scalate/documentation/tool.html) for creating new projects with Scalate more easily
* improved API for working with templates from different sources (file, URL, Source, String etc) via the helper methods on [TemplateSource object](http://scalate.github.io/scalate/maven/{project_snapshot_version:}/scalate-core/scaladocs/org/fusesource/scalate/TemplateSource$.html) and methods on [TemplateEngine](http://scalate.github.io/scalate/maven/{project_snapshot_version:}/scalate-core/scaladocs/org/fusesource/scalate/TemplateEngine.html) which take a [TemplateSource](http://scalate.github.io/scalate/maven/{project_snapshot_version:}/scalate-core/scaladocs/org/fusesource/scalate/TemplateSource.html)
* easier to configure whitespace handling via the **escapeMarkup** property on [TemplateEngine](http://scalate.github.io/scalate/maven/{project_snapshot_version:}/scalate-core/scaladocs/org/fusesource/scalate/TemplateEngine.html) and [RenderContext](http://scalate.github.io/scalate/maven/{project_snapshot_version:}/scalate-core/scaladocs/org/fusesource/scalate/RenderContext.html) so its easy to configure markup escaping for an entire project or enable/disable it within templates.

For more detail see the [Full Change Log](http://scalate.assembla.com/spaces/scalate/milestones/191837-1-1)


[Scalate 1.0](http://scalate.github.io/scalate/blog/releases/2010/04/release-1-0.html), released 2010-04-06
----

Initial release with support for the following template languages

* [Ssp](http://scalate.github.io/scalate/documentation/ssp-reference.html#syntax) which is like a Scala version of JSP or Erb from Rails 
* [Scaml](http://scalate.github.io/scalate/documentation/scaml-reference.html) which is a Scala dialect of [Haml](http://haml-lang.com/) for very DRY markup
