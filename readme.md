===============================

Scalate is a [Scala](http://www.scala-lang.org) based template engine which supports HAML, Mustache and JSP, Erb and Velocity style syntaxes.

The following template languages are supported:

  * [Mustache](http://scalate.github.io/scalate/documentation/mustache.html#features): is a Mustache template language for Java/Scala
  * [Jade](http://scalate.github.io/scalate/documentation/scaml-reference.html#jade): The Jade style of Haml/Scaml template lanaguage
  * [Scaml](http://scalate.github.io/scalate/documentation/scaml-reference.html#features): Provides Haml style template lanaguage
  * [Ssp](http://scalate.github.io/scalate/documentation/ssp-reference.html#syntax): Provides a JSP, Erb and Velocity style template language

In Scaml and SSP all expressions are typesafe and checked at edit/compile time to ensure you don't leave any mistakes in your pages.
Mustache uses dynamic typing and reflection; a trade off of hiding code and logic from inside the templates.
