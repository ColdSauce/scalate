    ### Windows 2000/XP
    
    1. [Download a distribution](../download.html) such as [#{project_version} zip](http://repo.fusesource.com/nexus/content/repositories/public/org/fusesource/scalate/scalate-distro/#{project_version}/scalate-distro-#{project_version}-windows-bin.zip)
    
    1. Unzip the distribution archive, i.e. `scalate-#{project_version}-windows-bin.zip` to the directory you wish to install Scalate #{project_version}. These instructions assume you chose `C:\Program Files\Scala`. The subdirectory `scalate-#{project_version}` will be created from the archive.
    1. Add the `C:\Program Files\Scala\scalate-#{project_version}\bin` directory to the `PATH` environment variable:
      1. Opening up the system properties using (**WinKey + Pause**).
      1. Selecting the **Advanced** tab.
      1. Click the **Environment Variables** button.
      1. Update/create the `PATH` variable in the user variables prepending the value `C:\Program Files\Scala\scalate-#{project_version}`. 
      1. Be sure to omit any quotation marks around the path even if it contains spaces. 
    1. In the same dialog, make sure that `JAVA\_HOME` exists in your user variables or in the system variables and it is set to the location of your JDK (e.g. `C:\Program Files\Java\jdk1.5.0\_02`).
    1. Make sure that `%JAVA\_HOME%\bin` is in your `PATH` environment variable.
    1. Open a new command prompt:
        1. Click **Winkey + R**.
        1. Type `cmd`.
    1. Run the following to verify that it is correctly installed.

            scalate
  
    ### Unix-based Operating Systems (Linux, Solaris and Mac OS X)

    1. [Download a distribution](../download.html) such as [#{project_version} tar.gz](http://repo.fusesource.com/nexus/content/repositories/public/org/fusesource/scalate/scalate-distro/#{project_version}/scalate-distro-#{project_version}-unix-bin.tar.gz)
    1. Extract the distribution archive, i.e. `scalate-#{project_version}-unix-bin.tar.gz` to the directory you wish to install Scalate #{project_version}. These instructions assume you chose `/usr/local/scala`. The subdirectory `scalate-#{project_version}` will be created from the archive.
    1. In a command terminal, prepend the `PATH` variable with the `bin` directory in the scalate release.

            export PATH=/usr/local/scala/scalate-#{project_version}/bin:$PATH
    
    1. Make sure that `JAVA\_HOME` is set to the location of your JDK.

            export JAVA_HOME=/usr/java/jdk1.5.0_02
    
    1. Make sure that `$JAVA\_HOME/bin` is in your `PATH` environment variable. 
    
            export PATH=$JAVA_HOME/bin:$PATH
    
    1. Run the following to verify that it is installed correctly

            scalate
      

    ### Mac OS X and Homebrew

    If you use OS X then we highly recommend using [Homebrew](http://mxcl.github.com/homebrew/) to manage installation of tools.
    
    1. If you have not done so already please [Install Homebrew](http://wiki.github.com/mxcl/homebrew/installation).
    1. Once you have Homebrew installed you can install Scalate via this command

            brew install scalate
      
        The scalate executable should now be available from any terminal.
    1. To verify this works try typing

            scalate

  :&markdown
    Scalate can be used as part of a Maven build by adding the following dependencies into your POM:
    
    {pygmentize:: xml}
        <dependencies>
          <dependency>
            <groupId>org.fusesource.scalate</groupId>
            <artifactId>scalate-wikitext</artifactId>
            <version>#{project_version}</version>  
          </dependency>
          <dependency>
            <groupId>org.fusesource.scalate</groupId>
            <artifactId>scalate-page</artifactId>
            <version>#{project_version}</version>  
          </dependency>

          <!-- testing -->
          <dependency>
            <groupId>org.fusesource.scalate</groupId>
            <artifactId>scalate-test</artifactId>
            <version>#{project_version}</version>  
            <scope>test</scope>
          </dependency>
        </dependencies>
      {pygmentize}

    **Note:** The path to your local Maven repository `.m2` cannot have any spaces.

    Once you have the application working and you've played with the [Console](console.html) you 
    might want to dive deeper into Scalate and understand how it works.

    * [Scalate Console](console.html)
    * [Documentation](index.html) for further information on user guides and template references
    * [FAQ](../faq.html) if you hit any issues along the way
