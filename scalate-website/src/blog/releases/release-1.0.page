The [Scalate team](http://scalate.fusesource.org) is pleased to announce the availability of Scalate 1.0. 

Scalate is a [Scala 2.8](http://www.scala-lang.org) based <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Template_engine_(web)">template engine</a> which can be used stand alone, with servlets, in JAXRS, with the [Play Framework](http://github.com/pk11/play-scalate) or in [Apache Camel](http://camel.apache.org/scalate.html). (Work on lift integration is in progress).

All expressions inside Scalate benefit from the full power of Scala plus they are typesafe and checked at edit/compile time to ensure you don't leave any mistakes in your templates.

Two template languages are currently supported:

* [Ssp](http://scalate.fusesource.org/documentation/ssp-reference.html#syntax) which is like a Scala version of JSP or Erb from Rails 
* [Scaml](http://scalate.fusesource.org/documentation/scaml-reference.html) which is a Scala dialect of [Haml](http://haml-lang.com/) for very DRY markup
